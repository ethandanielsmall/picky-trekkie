MVPS
- make html and buttons
- make database
- make queries that are made when buttons are clicked, so when a querry is called, it can pull up all the episodes in a given category
- randomize the querried episodes

ADDITIONAL TODOS
- add little enterprises/voyager/ds9/etc to top corner when a mouse is hovered on a series
- make loading transitions pretty
- make moving space background
- only have 1-3 episodes load, not all within a category
